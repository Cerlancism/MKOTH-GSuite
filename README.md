# Mobile King of the Hill Series Processor
## Introduction
The Google App Script project for MKOTH series processing and automation.  
This is loosely based on the old MKOTH code posted by Gim Leng aka saynotobloons aka icewarm2 on Pastebin:

## Prerequisite
For series submissions, basic validations are in place but these submissions are still recommended to be manually verified for authenticity, as anyone can use the submission form to create a malicious submission.

The code is however also designed to be able to revert any fake series submissions.

## TODO
- More JSON logging style to ease event parsing in the future
- Pass by reference for all player objects
- Holiday mode
- Point Adjustment
- Rank cleansing
- More validation
- Fake series revert overhaul
- ELO

# Mobile King of the Hill Series Processor
## Introduction
This is a Google Apps Script project for Mobile KOTH series processing and automation.  
This is loosely based on the old MKOTH code posted by Gim Leng aka saynotobloons aka icewarm2 on Pastebin:

## Prerequisite
For series submissions, basic validations are in place but these submissions are still recommended to be manually verified for authenticity, as anyone can use the submission form to create a malicious submission.

The code is however also designed to be able to revert any fake series submissions.

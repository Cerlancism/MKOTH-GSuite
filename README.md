# Mobile King of the Hill Series Processor
## Introduction
Google App Script codes for series processing and automation.
Loosely based on the old MKOTH code posted by Gim Leng aka saynotobloons aka icewarm2 on Pastebin:

## Prerequisite
Basic series validations are in place but series submissions are still to be manually verified for authenticity, as anyone can use the form to submit.

Code is also designed to be able to revert fake series submissions.

## TODO
- More JSON logging style to ease event parsing in the future
- Holiday mode
- Point Adjustment
- Rank cleansing
- More validation
- Fake series revert overhaul
- ELO
